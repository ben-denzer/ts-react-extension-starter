# Chrome Extension Template For TypeScript/React

This is a template for building Chrome extensions with TypeScript and React. It uses Vite to build the extension, and includes a simple example of a popup with a React component, a side panel with a React component, and a content script that can interact with the page, and a background script that can interact with the extension.

I have not solved the "hot reloading" problem, so for the "Action Popup" and the Side Panel, you need to close/reopen the popup or side panel to see changes. For the content script and the background script, you need to reload the extension in the Chrome extensions page.
